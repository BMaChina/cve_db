```python
with open('csv_list.txt', 'r') as csv_h:
        with CVE_DB() as db:
            for cve_name in csv_h:
                cve = cve_name.strip()
                v = VulnerabilityBuilder.get_vulnerability_by_cve_net(cve)
                if v is not None:
                    db.add_vulnerability(v)
```

#### DB lookup 
```python
with CVE_DB('db_file_name') as db:
